    "Limitations and assumptions:\n",
    "------------\n",
    "- The model is entirely based in simple power balancing. Losses due DC-DC conversion, transmission loss or power inversion are modeled with an efficiency coefficient on the panel side (`data.losses`), and not currently modeled between the battery and the loads. For now, DC-DC losses between the battery and the load should be taken account by increasing the load power specifications.\n",
    "- Related: a full battery charge/discharge curve isn't simulated in the state-of-charge integration. The SOC calculation does not take into account charge/discharge rate limitations or dynamics based on a specific battery chemistry.\n",
    "- The state of charge computed is NOT a percent of a nominal amp-hour rating (the usual definition of SOC), but of the user-set watt-hour value. \n",
    "- In a real-world setting, your effective solar line-of-sight may be limited due to objects on the horizon (trees, other structures, etc.) The NREL data, to my best understanding, is based on an assumption of unobstructed line-of-sight, which may not be the case especially at the very beginning and very end of the day where solar illumination is transitioning. However, I have included options for hard cut-off times to be set to model a real-world situation (see examples below).\n",

    "The model defaults to a demo API key that is presumably rate-limited. A free personal API key is available by signing up at: https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/\n",

    "\t- The model predicts that the system, run continuously, will never discharge the LiPo battery below 79.9%, reached during the winter (as expected). \n",
    "\t- Over the simulated year, It is also noted that a total of 6kWh of energy can be collected by the panel in its location, with 5kWh net collectible (total collectible energy minus LED energy use). \n",
    "\t- This 5kWh is wasted in a certain sense, but that is a normal trade-off with battery-backup PV systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first subplot (hourly power values) shows that we are unlikely to ever really get 5.2 W out of the panel. Over the course of the day, we get anywhere from 1 W to about 4 W. Also, the large amount of green (net) collectible energy shows that our load isn't using a large percentage of it most of the time during daylight hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second subplot (daily energy totals) shows that we can collect from 5 to 30 Wh energy every day from the panel (blue trace). The red trace shows the total load energy used each day, a constant 2.4 Wh every day for our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The third subplot (ambient conditions) shows ambient temperature variation over the year, 0 to 100 F transition over the course of the year. This doesn't tell us much here, but future versions of this model will allow this to be taken into account for battery charge characteristics, temperature-dependent load specifications, etc. \n",

An LVD could also be used in a case where the system doesn't really need to run continuously without any interruption, to simplify system design. But I tend to think of LVD like a fuse: something that should only operate as a contingency, and not as a normal part of operation."

It looks as though in the summer months, we get about 250 Wh worth of energy directed into the pump at the needed condition (30W PV available, > 32 degrees). Since at 30 W, the pump can move 3 liters per minute, or about 47 gallons per hour, this gives us  about 391 pumped gallons per day during summer. \n",

    "- Battery SOC is not adversely affected by the daytime pump operation, and has an acceptable discharge depth of 80% occurring in the winter. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Experimenting with the model shows that SOC is much more sensitive to the constant background loads than the pump load level, since the system will not operate the pump unless the panel can support it directly. Thus, the pump operation largely bypasses the battery storage, but uses energy during the day at the expense of operating the light at night (via the battery). \n",
    "- Interestingly, for a fixed PV array and battery size, the directly load power level (the pump wattage) that maximizes total energy delivered to the pump over the year is not directly intuitive - setting it very low does not deliver as much cumulative energy, while setting it too high does not turn it on often enough to maximize delivered energy. For a 100W panel + 420 Wh battery, a 30W pump seems to have about the maximum annual energy you can put to use - around the 45 kWh collected in the example. \n",
